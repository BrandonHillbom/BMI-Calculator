# BMI calculator

This is a simple body mass index calculator made with Flutter. While body mass indexes are seriously flawed in their analysis of a person's health, this was a simple app to make and a good introduction to working with Flutter and Dart.

## Running the app locally

Follow the steps outlined in [Flutter's getting started documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). Essentially, you will need to download the Flutter SDK, add it to your path, and then you will be able to run flutter run in your terminal.
